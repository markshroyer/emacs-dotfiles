EMACS CONFIGURATION DIRECTORY
=============================

Thigs is my emacs configuration directory, `~/.emacs.d/`.  It contains
my emacs configuration and abbreviation files, as well as any
extensions for the editor that I have written or downloaded myself.

To set this directory up as a local Emacs configuration, move it to
your `~/.emacs.d/` and create the following symbolic links:

	~/.emacs => ~/.emacs.d/emacs
	~/.abbrev_defs => ~/.emacs.d/abbrev_defs
