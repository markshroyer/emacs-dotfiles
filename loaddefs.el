Selecting an item from this menu will take point to the start of the

\\[haskell-ds-forward-decl] and \\[haskell-ds-backward-decl] move forward and backward to the start of a declaration.

Under XEmacs, the following keys are also defined:

\\[fume-list-functions] lists the declarations of the current buffer,
\\[fume-prompt-function-goto] prompts for a declaration to move to, and
\\[fume-mouse-function-goto] moves to the declaration whose name is at point.

This may link with `haskell-doc' (only for Emacs currently).

For non-literate and LaTeX-style literate scripts, we assume the
common convention that top-level declarations start at the first
column.  For Bird-style literate scripts, we assume the common
convention that top-level declarations start at the third column,
ie. after \"> \".

Anything in `font-lock-comment-face' is not considered for a
declaration.  Therefore, using Haskell font locking with comments
coloured in `font-lock-comment-face' improves declaration scanning.

To turn on declaration scanning for all Haskell buffers, add this to
.emacs:

  (add-hook 'haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-haskell-decl-scan)

To turn declaration scanning on for the current buffer, call
`turn-on-haskell-decl-scan'.

Literate Haskell scripts are supported: If the value of
`haskell-literate' (automatically set by the Haskell mode of
Moss&Thorn) is `bird', a Bird-style literate script is assumed.  If it
is nil or `tex', a non-literate or LaTeX-style literate script is
assumed, respectively.

Call FUNC at each headline selected by MATCH in SCOPE.

FUNC is a function or a lisp form.  The function will be called without
arguments, with the cursor positioned at the beginning of the headline.
The return values of all calls to the function will be collected and
returned as a list.

The call to FUNC will be wrapped into a save-excursion form, so FUNC
does not need to preserve point.  After evaluation, the cursor will be
moved to the end of the line (presumably of the headline of the
processed entry) and search continues from there.  Under some
circumstances, this may not produce the wanted results.  For example,
if you have removed (e.g. archived) the current (sub)tree it could
mean that the next entry will be skipped entirely.  In such cases, you
can specify the position from where search should continue by making
FUNC set the variable `org-map-continue-from' to the desired buffer
position.

MATCH is a tags/property/todo match as it is used in the agenda tags view.
Only headlines that are matched by this query will be considered during
the iteration.  When MATCH is nil or t, all headlines will be
visited by the iteration.

SCOPE determines the scope of this command.  It can be any of:

nil     The current buffer, respecting the restriction if any
tree    The subtree started with the entry at point
file    The current buffer, without restriction
file-with-archives
        The current buffer, and any archives associated with it
agenda  All agenda files
agenda-with-archives
        All agenda files with any archive files associated with them
\(file1 file2 ...)
        If this is a list, all files in the list will be scanned

The remaining args are treated as settings for the skipping facilities of
the scanner.  The following items can be given here:

  archive    skip trees with the archive tag.
  comment    skip trees with the COMMENT keyword
  function or Emacs Lisp form:
             will be used as value for `org-agenda-skip-function', so whenever
             the function returns t, FUNC will not be called for that
             entry and search will continue from the point where the
             function leaves it.

If your function needs to retrieve the tags including inherited tags
at the *current* entry, you can use the value of the variable
`org-scanner-tags' which will be much faster than getting the value
with `org-get-tags-at'.  If your function gets properties with
`org-entry-properties' at the *current* entry, bind `org-trust-scanner-tags'
to t around the call to `org-entry-properties' to get the same speedup.
Note that if your function moves around to retrieve tags and properties at
a *different* entry, you cannot use these techniques.

TODO entries.  The argument STRING can be used to pass a default search
string into this function.  If EDIT-AT is non-nil, it means that the
user should get a chance to edit this string, with cursor at position
EDIT-AT.

The search string is broken into \"words\" by splitting at whitespace.
Depending on the variable `org-agenda-search-view-search-words-only'
and on whether the first character in the search string is \"+\" or \"-\",
The string is then interpreted either as a substring with variable amounts
of whitespace, or as a list or individual words that should be matched.

The default is a substring match, where each space in the search string
can expand to an arbitrary amount of whitespace, including newlines.

If matching individual words, these words are then interpreted as a
boolean expression with logical AND.  Words prefixed with a minus must
not occur in the entry. Words without a prefix or prefixed with a plus
must occur in the entry.  Matching is case-insensitive and the words
are enclosed by word delimiters.

Words enclosed by curly braces are interpreted as regular expressions
that must or must not match in the entry.

If the search string starts with an asterisk, search only in headlines.
If (possibly after the leading star) the search string starts with an
exclamation mark, this also means to look at TODO entries only, an effect

Return diary information from org-files.
This function can be used in a \"sexp\" diary entry in the Emacs calendar.
It accesses org files and extracts information from those files to be
listed in the diary.  The function accepts arguments specifying what
items should be listed.  The following arguments are allowed:

   :timestamp    List the headlines of items containing a date stamp or
		 date range matching the selected date.  Deadlines will
		 also be listed, on the expiration day.

   :sexp         List entries resulting from diary-like sexps.

   :deadline     List any deadlines past due, or due within
		 `org-deadline-warning-days'.  The listing occurs only
		 in the diary for *today*, not at any other date.  If
		 an entry is marked DONE, it is no longer listed.

   :scheduled    List all items which are scheduled for the given date.
		 The diary for *today* also contains items which were
		 scheduled earlier and are not yet marked DONE.

   :todo         List all TODO items from the org-file.  This may be a
		 long list - so this is not turned on by default.
		 Like deadlines, these entries only show up in the
		 diary for *today*, not at any other date.

The call in the diary file should look like this:

   &%%(org-diary) ~/path/to/some/orgfile.org

Use a separate line for each org file to check.  Or, if you omit the file name,
all files listed in `org-agenda-files' will be checked automatically:

   &%%(org-diary)

If you don't give any arguments (as in the example above), the default
arguments (:deadline :scheduled :timestamp :sexp) are used.
So the example above may also be written as

   &%%(org-diary :deadline :timestamp :sexp :scheduled)

The function expects the lisp variables `entry' and `date' to be provided
