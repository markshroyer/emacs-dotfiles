Module::Name - Description of module's purpose

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Module::Name version 0.0.1.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Module::Name;

Brief but working examples showing most common usage...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A full description of the module and its features.  May include numerous
subsections (=head2, =head3, etc.)

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

A separate section listing the public components of the module's interface.
These normally consist of either subroutines that may be exported, or methods
that may be called on objects belonging to the classes that the module
provides.  Name the section accordingly.

In an object-oriented module, this section should begin with a sentence of the
form "An object of this class represents...", to give the reader a
high-level context to help them understand the methods that are subsequently
described.

the ones that will "never happen"), with a full explanation of each problem,
one or more likely causes, and any suggested remedies.

of any environment variables or properties that can be set.  These
descriptions must also include details of any configuration langauge used.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

A list of all the other modules that this module relies upon, including any
restrictions on versions, and an indication of whether these required modules
are part of the standard perl distribution, part of the module's distribution,
or must be installed separately.

=item L<Net::Wake>

=back

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

A list of any modules that this module cannot be used in conjunction with.
This may be due to name conflicts in the interface, or competition for system
or program resources, or due to internal limitations of Perl (for example,
many modules that use source code filters are mutually incompatible).

=over 4

=item L<Evil::Module>

If this module is used with L<Evil::Module> installed, things will blow up.

=back

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

A list of known problems with the module, together with some indication of
whether they are likely to be fixed in an upcoming release.

Also a list of restrictions on the features the module does provide: data
types that cannot be handled, performance issues and the circumstances in
which they may arise, practical limitations on the size of data sets, special
cases that are not (yet) handled, etc.

The initial documentation usually just has:

There are no known bugs in this module.
